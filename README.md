## Project Overview
ecoFashion is a feature-rich e-commerce solution aimed at fostering sustainability within the fashion industry. It integrates user management, product categorization, sustainability rating systems, and an interactive shopping experience. The platform utilizes a powerful backend with Node.js and Express.js, a dynamic frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and PostgreSQL for efficient database management.

   - Track their ecoScore based on sustainable shopping habits.
2. Product Transparency
   - Offers in-depth insights into the production process of each product.
   - Showcases sustainability metrics, including ecoScores and ecoRatings.
4. ecoScore & ecoRating System
   - Consumers earn an ecoScore based on their purchases.
   - Suppliers receive an ecoRating reflecting the sustainability of their products.
   - Users can filter and sort products based on ecoScore, ecoRating, price, and customer reviews
4. Product & Resource Management
   - Suppliers can add, update, and remove products from the platform.
   - Products are categorized efficiently for seamless browsing.
   - Consumers can search for items using various filters.

## Prerequisites
